    "def Statements (Function Definitions):\n",
    "def statements are used to define named functions in Python.\n",
    "They provide a way to define reusable blocks of code with a specific name.\n",
    "Named functions are created using the def keyword followed by a function name, a set of parameters enclosed in parentheses, and a block of code indented under the def statement.\n",
    "Named functions can have multiple statements, perform complex operations, and include documentation strings (docstrings).\n",
    "They are suitable for defining functions that are used multiple times and perform various tasks within a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "def add(x, y):\n",
    "    return x + y\n",
    "\n",
    "Lambda Expressions (Anonymous Functions):\n",
    "Lambda expressions are used to create small, anonymous functions without a specific name.\n",
    "They are also known as lambda functions or anonymous functions.\n",
    "Lambda expressions are defined using the lambda keyword followed by a set of parameters and an expression to be evaluated.\n",
    "They are typically used for simple, one-liner functions and are often used in situations where a function is needed as an argument to another function (e.g., in sorting or mapping operations).\n",

    "2. What is the benefit of lambda?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Conciseness: Lambda expressions allow you to define small, inline functions without the need to write a full def statement. This conciseness is particularly useful when you need a simple function for a short task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Readability: Lambda expressions can make the code more readable when used appropriately. They can be especially helpful when passed as arguments to higher-order functions like map(), filter(), and sorted(), where a full def statement might be less clear.\n",
    "\n",
    "Function as Data: In Python, functions are first-class citizens, which means they can be treated like any other data type. Lambdas can be assigned to variables, stored in data structures, and passed as arguments to other functions. This flexibility allows for dynamic and functional programming paradigms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Avoiding Function Name Conflicts: Since lambda functions are anonymous and do not have a specific name, they do not pollute the global namespace with function names. This can help avoid potential naming conflicts in larger codebases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Immediate Use: Lambda functions are often used for small, one-time operations where it's not necessary to give the function a name or define it elsewhere in the code. They are useful when you need a quick, disposable function for a specific task."

    "    return a + b\n",

    "Accessing Annotations:\n",
    "\n",
    "Function annotations are not enforced by Python's type system, so they don't affect the runtime behavior of the code.\n",
    "However, you can access these annotations using the __annotations__ attribute of the function, which returns a dictionary containing the annotations.\n",

    "7. Name three or more ways that functions can communicate results to a caller.\n",
