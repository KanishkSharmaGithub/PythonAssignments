    "Iterator:\n",
    "\n",
    "An iterator is an object in Python that implements the iterator protocol, which consists of two methods: __iter__() and __next__().\n",
    "The __iter__() method returns the iterator object itself, and the __next__() method returns the next value from the iterable.\n",
    "When you iterate over a sequence (e.g., a list, tuple, or string), Python creates an iterator behind the scenes to keep track of the current position and fetch the next item.\n",

    "        self.data = data\n",

    "Generator:\n",
    "\n",
    "A generator is a special type of iterator defined using a function with one or more yield statements.\n",
    "When a function contains yield, it becomes a generator function, and calling this function returns a generator object.\n",

    "3) What are the signs that a function is a generator function?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Use of the yield Keyword:\n",
    "\n",
    "The most prominent sign of a generator function is the use of the yield keyword within the function body.\n",
    "A generator function typically contains one or more yield statements to produce values one at a time, and it temporarily suspends its execution state when yield is encountered.\n",
    "\n",
    "No return Statement for Values:\n",
    "\n",
    "Generator functions often lack a return statement that returns a value directly. Instead, they use yield to produce values incrementally.\n",
    "A generator function may or may not have a return statement, but the values produced by the yield statements take precedence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generator Object Creation:\n",
    "\n",
    "When a generator function is called, it returns a generator object without executing the function body.\n",
    "This generator object is iterable and can be used to iterate through the values produced by the yield statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Execution State Preservation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Generator functions preserve their execution state between calls, allowing them to remember where they left off.\n",
    "This is different from regular functions, which start from the beginning every time they are called.\n"

    "4) What is the purpose of a yield statement?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Lazy Evaluation:\n",
    "\n",
    "When a generator function contains a yield statement, it doesn't compute and produce all its values at once.\n",
    "Instead, it generates and yields values one at a time, as requested by the caller, allowing for lazy evaluation.\n",
    "Lazy evaluation can be memory-efficient, especially when dealing with large data sets or infinite sequences, as it avoids storing all values in memory simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "State Preservation:\n",
    "\n",
    "The yield statement temporarily suspends the execution of the generator function and preserves its internal state, including local variables and the position within the function.\n",
    "When the generator is resumed (typically through iteration), it continues execution from where it left off, using the preserved state information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Iterative Processing:\n",
    "\n",
    "Generator functions are often used to perform iterative or sequential processing tasks.\n",
    "The yield statement allows a function to produce a value, pause, and then resume execution when the next value is requested, making it well-suited for tasks like iterating through a file, database results, or streaming data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Infinite Sequences:\n",
    "\n",
    "yield is particularly useful for generating infinite sequences, such as an infinite sequence of natural numbers or a generator that generates values based on certain criteria.\n",
    "Without yield, creating and storing an entire infinite sequence in memory would not be practical.\n",

    "5) What is the relationship between map calls and list comprehensions? Make a comparison and\n",
    "contrast between the two.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "map() is a built-in Python function that takes two arguments: a function and an iterable (or multiple iterables).\n",
    "It applies the given function to each element of the iterable(s) and returns a map object (an iterable) that can be converted to a list or another data structure if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Case:\n",
    "\n",
    "map() is primarily used when you want to apply a function to every element of an iterable and create a new iterable with the transformed values.\n",
    "It's useful for simple element-wise transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Function Requirement:\n",
    "\n",
    "The function passed to map() should take one or more arguments (depending on the number of input iterables) and return a single value for each element.\n",
    "\n",
    "Result Type:\n",
    "\n",
    "map() returns a map object, which is an iterable. To get the result as a list, you often need to convert it using list().\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Case:\n",
    "\n",
    "List comprehensions are versatile and can be used not only for mapping but also for filtering and creating new lists with specific criteria.\n",
    "They are suitable for complex transformations and conditional filtering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Function Requirement:\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike map(), list comprehensions do not require a separate function. Instead, you provide an expression that defines how each item should be transformed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both map() and list comprehensions can be used to process iterable data and apply transformations.\n",
    "map() is more suitable for simple element-wise transformations when you have a specific function to apply.\n",
    "List comprehensions are more versatile, allowing for complex expressions and conditional filtering within a single concise statement.\n",
    "List comprehensions directly create lists as output, whereas map() returns a map object that often needs to be converted to a list."
