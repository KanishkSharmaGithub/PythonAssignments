    "1. What does RGBA stand for?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "RGBA stands for \"Red, Green, Blue, Alpha.\" It is a color model used in digital graphics and computer imaging to describe colors. RGBA is an extension of the RGB color model, with an additional channel known as the alpha channel.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a breakdown of each component in the RGBA color model:\n",
    "\n",
    "R (Red): The red component determines the amount of red color in the pixel. It can have values ranging from 0 (no red) to 255 (full intensity red).\n",
    "\n",
    "G (Green): The green component determines the amount of green color in the pixel. It can have values ranging from 0 (no green) to 255 (full intensity green).\n",
    "\n",
    "B (Blue): The blue component determines the amount of blue color in the pixel. It can have values ranging from 0 (no blue) to 255 (full intensity blue).\n",
    "\n",
    "A (Alpha): The alpha component represents the pixel's transparency or opacity. It can have values ranging from 0 (completely transparent) to 255 (completely opaque). An alpha value of 255 means the pixel is fully visible, while an alpha value of 0 means the pixel is fully transparent."
