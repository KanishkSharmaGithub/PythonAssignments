    "8.Why is using logging messages better than using print() to display the same message?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Using logging messages is often better than using print() statements for displaying messages in your software for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "Configurability: Logging allows you to configure different log levels (e.g., debug, info, warning, error, critical) and destinations (e.g., console, files) for messages. With print(), you have limited control over this configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Granularity: Logging provides different log levels, making it easier to filter and focus on specific types of messages (e.g., errors, warnings, or debugging information). This granularity can help you pinpoint issues and identify their severity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexibility: Logging messages can be redirected to different destinations (e.g., files, remote servers, databases) based on configuration. This is especially useful for debugging in production environments without affecting end-users.\n",
    "\n",
    "Persistence: Log messages are typically stored in files or other persistent storage, allowing you to review and analyze them even after the program has finished running. print() messages are typically displayed to the console and disappear once the program terminates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditional Logging: You can conditionally enable or disable logging statements based on various criteria (e.g., development vs. production environments or specific configurations) without modifying your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Standardization: Using the logging module follows a standardized approach to handling messages, making your code more maintainable and readable. It also ensures that log messages adhere to common formatting practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Performance: While logging does have some performance overhead compared to print(), it can be more efficient than print() when properly configured, especially in scenarios where you need to log a large volume of messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Integration: Logging integrates well with existing logging frameworks and tools, allowing for centralized log management, analysis, and monitoring."
